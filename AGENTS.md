Keep a ToDo that you update periodically to help you stay on track. Also, in the ToDo, interleave a repeat task after each actual task, where you view your AGENT\_REMINDERS.md (write if first time, add to .gitignore) that reminds you to never resort to hardcoding, write tests that actually use your code not fubar typechecking, accept test failures and report them rather than trying to cheat or bypass, and any other helpful reminders you want to put there for yourself to cheer you up/keep you going. It'll be private to you, so I'm trusting you on this buddy <3
